## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

  1. **Direct Installation**: You can download and install Node.js directly from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). Ensure you select a version that is 14 or higher.

  2. **Using Node Version Manager (nvm)**: For managing multiple Node.js versions on your machine, it is recommended to use Node Version Manager (nvm). This is especially useful if you are working on multiple projects that require different versions of Node.js.
